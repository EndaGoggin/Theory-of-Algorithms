# Theory-of-Algorithms

## Overview
This repository was created for the Theory of Algorithms (45699) module in the final year of  Atlantic Technological University (ATU).

The requirements for this project were to create a README and two seperate Jupyter notebooks based on both the Post correspondence problem and the game Countdown. 

The **Post Correspondence Notebook** requirements:

* Definition and explanation of the Post Correspondence Problem.

* Definition and explanation of the Bounded Post Correspondence Problem.

* Python function to solve the Bounded Post Correspondence Problem. The function
should take two lists of strings and return True if they correspond, False otherwise.

* Explanation of what an undecidable problem is in computability theory, with reference to the Post Correspondence Problem.

The **Countdown Numbers Game Notebook** requirements:

* Overview and explanation of the Countdown Numbers Game.

* Discussion of the complexity of the Countdown Numbers Game.

* Python function, written in a functional programming style to solve a Countdown Numbers Game. The function should take a list of six numbers and a target
number and return a method to calculate the target from the numbers, if it exists..

* Explanation of the functional aspects of your code.

The **README** requirements:

* Clear and informative README.md explaining why the repository exists, what is in
it, and how to run the notebooks.

*  Comprehensive commit history, with each commit representing a reasonable unit
of work.

All three of these files are in the base directory of this repository above.
